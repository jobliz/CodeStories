CodeStories
===========

A Computer Science / Literature Project for Merging Code and Fiction

This idea is at a very early stage. As of now, our goal is to collect "stories" written in a programming language. There's not much else about it, but some possible future endeavors could be:

* Algorithmic plot generation
* ASCII art.

Etc.
